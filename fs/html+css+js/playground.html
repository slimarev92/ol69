            <p>
                <em>Il Porcellino</em> (Italian "piglet") is the local Florentine nickname for the bronze fountain of a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B" title="Boar - Wikipedia">boar</a>. The
                fountain figure was sculpted and cast by Baroque master <em>Pietro Tacca</em> (1577â€“1640) shortly before
                1634,<sup>[1]</sup> following a marble Italian copy of a Hellenistic marble original, at the time in the
                Grand Ducal collections and today on display in the classical section of the Uffizi Museum. The
                original,
                which was found in Rome and removed to Florence in the mid-16th century by the Medici, was associated
                from
                the time of its rediscovery with the Calydonian Boar of Greek myth.<sup>[2]</sup>

            <p>
                Tacca's bronze, which has eclipsed the Roman marble that served as model,<sup>[3]</sup> was originally
                intended for the Boboli Garden, then moved to the Mercato Nuovo in Florence, Italy; the fountain was
                placed
                originally facing east, in via Calimala, in front of the pharmacy that by association gained the name
                Farmacia del Cinghiale (Italian for "boar"). To gain more space for market traffic it was later moved to
                the
                side facing south, where it still stands as one of the most popular features for tourists. The present
                statue is a modern copy, cast in 1998 by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry and replaced in 2008,
                while
                Tacca's bronze is sheltered in the new Museo Stefano Bardini in Palazzo Mozzi.<sup>[citation

            <p>
                Visitors to Il Porcellino put a coin into the boar's gaping jaws, with the intent to let it fall through
                the
                underlying grating for good luck, and they rub the boar's snout to ensure a return to Florence, a
                tradition
                that the Scottish literary traveller Tobias Smollett already noted in 1766,<sup>[4]</sup> which has kept
                the
                snout in a state of polished sheen while the rest of the boar's body has patinated to a dull
                brownish-green.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            <p>
                Il Porcellino appears in the 2001 film Hannibal when Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)
                cleans his hands in the fountain.

            <p>
                The statue is also seen briefly in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) as Harry Potter and
                Ron
                Weasley climb the Hogwarts staircase after crashing into the Whomping Willow, and again on the same
                staircase during the flashback scene where Tom Riddle speaks to Albus Dumbledore. It also appears in
                Harry
                Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II (2011) in the Room of Requirement.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

                In 1962's film Light in the Piazza, starring Olivia De Havilland, George Hamilton, and Yvette Mimieux, a
                young George Hamilton plays Fabrizio. After buying flowers for Yvette's character, Clara, he pats the
                boars snout for luck. Citation: Light in the Piazza. Arthur Freed. MGM, February 7, 1962. Film.
